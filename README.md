This project was proposed as an optional exercise for a better understanding of how HoltWinters algorithm works.

On it, the HoltWinters algorithm is programmed explaining every step and also, a method for avoiding local optimums and not desiderable solutions is proposed, even if it takes some time not immediately.
This method consists of exploring different combinations of initials parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for not falling in a extremelly blind solutions.

The code is explained, it is easy to understand and it is not a complex problem.
Also, a file with both a simulated and a _more realistic_ case study is available, where we compare the default function and our implementation, and it is visible that they are the same in terms of performance. Even though a better study of this comparison could be carried out.
